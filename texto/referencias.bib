ABSTRACT = {As the global population grows, and urbanization becomes more prevalent, cities often struggle to provide convenient, secure, and sustainable lifestyles due to the lack of necessary smart technologies. Fortunately, the Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a solution to this challenge by connecting physical objects using electronics, sensors, software, and communication networks. This has transformed smart city infrastructures, introducing various technologies that enhance sustainability, productivity, and comfort for urban dwellers. By leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) to analyze the vast amount of IoT data available, new opportunities are emerging to design and manage futuristic smart cities. In this review article, we provide an overview of smart cities, defining their characteristics and exploring the architecture of IoT. A detailed analysis of various wireless communication technologies employed in smart city applications is presented, with extensive research conducted to determine the most appropriate communication technologies for specific use cases. The article also sheds light on different AI algorithms and their suitability for smart city applications. Furthermore, the integration of IoT and AI in smart city scenarios is discussed, emphasizing the potential contributions of 5G networks coupled with AI in advancing modern urban environments. This article contributes to the existing literature by highlighting the tremendous opportunities presented by integrating IoT and AI, paving the way for the development of smart cities that significantly enhance the quality of life for urban dwellers while promoting sustainability and productivity. By exploring the potential of IoT, AI, and their integration, this review article provides valuable insights into the future of smart cities, demonstrating how these technologies can positively impact urban environments and the well-being of their inhabitants.},

ABSTRACT = {With the rapid growth of population and the increasing demand for food worldwide, improving productivity in farming procedures is essential. Smart farming is a concept that emphasizes the use of modern technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance productivity in farming practices. In a smart farming scenario, large amounts of data are collected from diverse sources such as wireless sensor networks, network-connected weather stations, monitoring cameras, and smartphones. These data are valuable resources to be used in data-driven services and decision support systems (DSS) in farming applications. However, one of the major challenges with these large amounts of agriculture data is their immense diversity in terms of format and meaning. Moreover, the different services and technologies in a smart farming ecosystem have limited capability to work together due to the lack of standardized practices for data and system integration. These issues create a significant challenge in cooperative service provision, data and technology integration, and data-sharing practices. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose the platform approach, a design approach intended to guide building effective, reliable, and robust smart farming systems. The proposed platform approach considers six requirements for seamless integration, processing, and use of farm data. These requirements in a smart farming platform include interoperability, reliability, scalability, real-time data processing, end-to-end security and privacy, and standardized regulations and policies. A smart farming platform that considers these requirements leads to increased productivity, profitability, and performance of connected smart farms. In this paper, we aim at introducing the platform approach concept for smart farming and reviewing the requirements for this approach.},

abstract = {By 2020, more than 50 billion devices will be connected through radio communications. In conjunction with the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) market, low power wide area networks (LPWAN) have become a popular low-rate long-range radio communication technology. Sigfox, LoRa, and NB-IoT are the three leading LPWAN technologies that compete for large-scale IoT deployment. This paper provides a comprehensive and comparative study of these technologies, which serve as efficient solutions to connect smart, autonomous, and heterogeneous devices. We show that Sigfox and LoRa are advantageous in terms of battery lifetime, capacity, and cost. Meanwhile, NB-IoT offers benefits in terms of latency and quality of service. In addition, we analyze the IoT success factors of these LPWAN technologies, and we consider application scenarios and explain which technology is the best fit for each of these scenarios.}

ABSTRACT = {The technology development in wireless sensor network (WSN) offers a sustainable solution towards precision agriculture (PA) in greenhouses. It helps to effectively use the agricultural resources and management tools and monitors different parameters to attain better quality yield and production. WSN makes use of Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs), a wireless technology to transmit data over long distances with minimal power consumption. LoRaWAN is one of the most successful LPWAN technologies despite its low data rate and because of its low deployment and management costs. Greenhouses are susceptible to different types of interference and diversification, demanding an improved WSN design scheme. In this paper, we contemplate the viable challenges for PA in greenhouses and propose the successive steps essential for effectual WSN deployment and facilitation. We performed a real-time, end-to-end deployment of a LoRaWAN-based sensor network in a greenhouse of the ’Proefcentrum Hoogstraten’ research center in Belgium. We have designed a dashboard for better visualization and analysis of the data, analyzed the power consumption for the LoRaWAN communication, and tried three different enclosure types (commercial, simple box and airflow box, respectively). We validated the implications of real-word challenges on the end-to-end deployment and air circulation for the correct sensor readings. We found that temperature and humidity have a larger impact on the sensor readings inside the greenhouse than we initially thought, which we successfully solved through the airflow box design.},

ABSTRACT = {Presently, the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT)-related technologies in the Smart Farming domain is rapidly emerging. The ultimate goal is to collect, monitor, and effectively employ relevant data for agricultural processes, with the purpose of achieving an optimized and more environmentally sustainable agriculture. In this paper, a low-cost, modular, and Long-Range Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN)-based IoT platform, denoted as “LoRaWAN-based Smart Farming Modular IoT Architecture” (LoRaFarM), and aimed at improving the management of generic farms in a highly customizable way, is presented. The platform, built around a core middleware, is easily extensible with ad-hoc low-level modules (feeding the middleware with data coming from the sensors deployed in the farm) or high-level modules (providing advanced functionalities to the farmer). The proposed platform has been evaluated in a real farm in Italy, collecting environmental data (air/soil temperature and humidity) related to the growth of farm products (namely grapes and greenhouse vegetables) over a period of three months. A web-based visualization tool for the collected data is also presented, to validate the LoRaFarM architecture.},
